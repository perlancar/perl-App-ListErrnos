0.070   2023-11-23  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Urgency: medium

        - Fix exit status (thanks Lukas Mai / MAUKE).

          `exit` has higher precedence than `?:`, so `exit $found ? 0 : 1`
          parses as `(exit $found) ? 0 : 1`, which is not what was intended.


0.06    2017-08-10  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- [optimize] Remove perl 5.010 requirement, avoid strict+warnings
	  in built version.


0.05    2015-09-10  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- [Bugfix] Use Errno instead of naively iterating from 1..N (the codes
	  list is not a single contiguous block).


0.04    2015-09-10  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- [Bugfix] Show all string matches, don't exit after the first
	  match.


0.03    2015-09-10  Released-By: PERLANCAR

        - Rename dist/script from App-errnos to App-errno.

        - Reduce deps by not using Perinci::CmdLine or
          Perinci::Sub::Gen::AccessTable, the dist now only depends on
          Getopt::Long::EvenLess.

        - Allow searching/showing a single errno (e.g. 'errno 23'). Searching
          errno string messages still work (e.g. 'errno file').

        - Listing errnos becomes 'errno --list' (or -l).


0.02    2015-09-10  Released-By: PERLANCAR

	- No functional changes.

	- Add sample output in script's POD.
